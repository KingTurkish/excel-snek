To customize the looks of the game you can edit the RGB colours in the code

StartGame() sub under ' --- Colours ---

```
 ' --- Colours ---
    boardColor = RGB(255, 246, 211)
    snakeBodyColor = RGB(249, 168, 117)
    snakeheadColor = RGB(235, 107, 111)
    appleColor = RGB(0, 112, 192)
    wallColor = RGB(64, 64, 64)
```

To customize the levels of the game you can edit Level Progression settings in the code

```
Sub LevelUp()
    level = level + 1
    
    If level > 31 Then level = 30 'stops game at end level instead of 30 for scoreboard
    
    ' Determine apples required for this level (change these settings if you want things to be harder)
    Select Case level
        Case 1 To 4
            applesForNextLevel = 5
            applesEaten = 0
        Case 5
            applesForNextLevel = 10
            applesEaten = 0
            StartSpecialLevel

            ClearWalls
            applesForNextLevel = 5
